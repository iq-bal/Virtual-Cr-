This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Description

Embarking on an Advanced Programming lab project, I took the lead in crafting an application.

This cutting-edge platform is meticulously engineered to elevate the student experience with a suite of indispensable features: 

**Upcoming Schedules:** Receive timely updates on imminent class tests, assignments, and lab sessions. 
**Daily Class Routine:** Effortlessly navigate through the daily class schedule for a quick grasp of the day's agenda. 
**Classmate Communication:** Foster seamless communication by connecting with classmates through the app. 
**Blood Group Search:** Enhance community engagement by allowing users to locate classmates based on their blood group. 
**Hall of Fame:** Establish a dedicated space to celebrate the accomplishments of peers, creating a positive and motivating environment. 
**Birthday Love:** Express heartfelt sentiments on friends' birthdays, infusing a personalized touch into the virtual space. 
**Attendance Calculator:** Ensure precise attendance tracking, streamlining calculations at the semester's conclusion. 

Guided by the belief that design enhances user experience, Virtual Cr features a dynamic interface. Recognizing the monotony of black-and-white class routines, the app aims to infuse enthusiasm into routine academic tasks.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
